* In this example we look at the weights of a sample of men and women.
<br>  
* **Dataset**: "Davis" in the package "car"
    + Type ?Davis for information on the package
<br>  
* **Grouping**: Decided whether to show the whole sample, males, females or males/females grouped in the same plot (you can also add means)
* **Systematic error (males)**: Add a systematic error of different size to every male (added error is the same across all male observations).
* **Systematic error (females)**: Add a systematic error of different size to every female (added error is the same across all female observations)
* **Systematic error (y values)**: Add a systematic error depending on different values of y = weight. It adds errors for the lower and upper quartile of observations. Lower values of y get a positive systematic bias, higher values get a negative systematic bias.
<br>  
* Hypothetical (!) scenario: In the present data systematic errors may appear because males give sysemtatically different answers regarding their weight than women. Moreover, people who weigh more give systematically lower values, whereas people who weigh less give systematically higher values. All these errors are added up and result in a different distribution for the full sample as well as subdistributions for men and women. Generally, it's an illustration of how different systematic errors might flow into the distribution of a single variable.
